      During my time at WSB Merito University, I've had the opportunity to gain knowledge primarily from a practical perspective while also covering theoretical aspects, which are just as important as practice. I've honed my programming skills in Python, mainly in web development and AI/ML. I've also gained experience in .NET development and in programming for the Arduino platform.

      However, computer science isn't just about programming &mdash; I've also completed courses in computer networks, database management, server administration on both Windows and Linux, Bash scripting, and software testing.

      Additionally, I've completed courses that I consider crucial for future IT graduates, such as mathematics, physics, and algorithms and data structures. These subjects have helped me develop logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and critical thinking skills. I've also had the chance to participate in an Agile methodology course.

      During my specialization, I've worked with platforms such as AWS and Azure, though I've dedicated most of my time to AWS. I've gained valuable experience using tools like Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, Pulumi, Helm, Grafana, and Docker.

      I've also had the opportunity to observe best practices in software development from more experienced colleagues, as well as share my knowledge with those who are just beginning their journey in the field.
