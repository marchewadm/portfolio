      I've been passionate about computers and technology since childhood. I still vividly remember the day my father taught me how to build a PC &dash; an experience that sparked my curiosity and set me on a lifelong journey of figuring out how things work. That moment laid the foundation for my ongoing exploration of the digital world.

      While technology plays a huge role in my life, my interests extend far beyond it. Music has always been a constant companion, whether in the raw energy of rock or the immersive depth of ambient soundscapes. I'm also a big fan of literature &dash; everything from sci-fi and fantasy to philosophical classics. These stories and ideas push me to see things from different angles and challenge the way I think.
