      When I'm not staring at lines of code for hours, I love brewing a cup of tea, grabbing a book, and getting lost in the worlds of sci-fi literature. It's an incredible escape from everyday life &mdash; reading allows me to experience things I might never encounter otherwise. It's a great workout for the mind, a moment of relaxation, and an opportunity for self-reflection all at once.

      I live by the saying <q>Mens sana in corpore sano</q> &mdash; a healthy mind in a healthy body. That's why, for many years now, I've made sports a regular part of my life, whether it's skateboarding, running, or cycling. Physical activity is the perfect way to refresh and clear my mind.

      I'm also a huge fan of ambient music, especially space ambient, which can spark the imagination just as much as a well-written book. Additionally, I enjoy louder genres like rock and metal, as well as the vibes of liquid drum and bass &mdash; and I even used to play guitar myself!
