      I've volunteered as part of the Fedora Localization Project. I've translated software, documentation, and interface elements into Polish, which resulted in high-quality translations that improved the user experience for the Polish-speaking community.

      Personally, I use English as my primary language on all of my desktops, but I know many people prefer to use their native language as the default, and I fully understand and respect that preference. These individuals are the main reason why I contribute to the Fedora Localization Project &dash; to apply my knowledge and assist others when using or considering using Fedora Linux.
