title: It's finally here!
description: When I started, the blog was the least important part - I mainly wanted to showcase myself and my previous projects. At the same time, I wanted to improve my skills in Vue.js and Nuxt.js, and I think this project definitely helped me do that. I also got to polish my TypeScript skills and gain experience in general application architecture.

This won't be a very long post. I must admit, I don't really have a detailed plan for it yet. :smile:

For now, I just want to say hello to my potential readers. I finally managed to finish this website, which took me some time, but I think it was worth it. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the result.

## What Inspired Me to Create My Portfolio

When I started, the blog was the least important part - I mainly wanted to showcase myself and my previous projects. At the same time, I wanted to improve my skills in Vue.js and Nuxt.js, and I think this project definitely helped me do that. I also got to polish my TypeScript skills and gain experience in general application architecture.

So, what about the blog? That idea came a bit later. I figured that maybe someday I would have something interesting to share with others, so why not include this feature right away, especially since I'm already using Nuxt Content - just instead of putting it under "selected works", it would go to the blog as well. And that's how the idea for my blog was born.

## What Kind of Posts Can You Expect Here?

Depending on how much free time I have at any given moment, I'll write posts accordingly. They will mostly cover programming and Linux, maybe a bit more about me and my thoughts on technology. Perhaps I'll share what I've learned over the past month? Well, from here, I can only say one thing: time will tell.
